# Core Data Structures

Tests and implementations for common data structures. See the full list in the [data-structures.md](data-structures.md) file.

Base repository for the [Core Data Structures](http://jsdev.learnersguild.org/goals/128) goal.

## Specs

- [ ] Artifact produced is a fork of the [core-data-structures][core-data-structures] repo.
- [ ] Can run all tests with `npm test`.
- [ ] All tests are passing.
- [ ] For each data structure in [the list][list-ds], there exists:
  - [ ] a test file with unit tests for each method and property.
  - [ ] an implementation file with a correct implementation of the data structure.
- [ ] Repository includes a README file with basic installation and setup instructions.
- [ ] All dependencies are properly declared in `package.json`.
- [ ] All major features are added via pull requests with a clear description and concise commit messages.
- [ ] Code uses a linter and there are no linting errors.
- [ ] Variables, functions, files, etc. have appropriate and meaningful names.
- [ ] Functions are small and serve a single purpose.
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].

### Stretch

Pick a _different_ programming language from JavaScript (e.g. Ruby, Swift, Python, C, Java...) and write tests & implementations for each.

- [ ] Can run all non-JavaScript tests with a single command.
- [ ] For each data structure identified above, there exists:
  - [ ] a test file with unit tests for each method and property _in a language other than JavaScript_.
  - [ ] an implementation file with a correct implementation of the data structure _in a language other than JavaScript_.
