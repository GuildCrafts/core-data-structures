# Core Data Structures

Tests and implementations for common data structures.

Base repository for the [Core Data Structures](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js/issues/128) goal.

## Installation and Setup

## Usage and Examples

## Specifications

_List of specifications (specs) for the completed goal. These are declarative sentences (statements) describing a feature of the final product._

**This is a core goal. The specifications are non-negotiable. To complete this goal, you must complete all specs listed below.**

- [X] Artifact produced is a fork of the [core-data-structures][core-data-structures] repo.
- [X] Can run all tests with `npm test`.
- [X] All tests are passing.
- [ ] For each data structure identified above, there exists:
  - [ ] a test file with unit tests for each method and property.
  - [ ] an implementation file with a correct implementation of the data structure.

### Required

_Do not remove these specs - they are required for all goals_.

- [X] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].

### Stretch

Pick a _different_ programming language from JavaScript--we chose Ruby! Write tests & implementations for each.

- [X] Can run all non-JavaScript tests with a single command.
- [ ] For each data structure identified above, there exists:
  - [ ] a test file with unit tests for each method and property _in a language other than JavaScript_ (ruby).
  - [ ] an implementation file with a correct implementation of the data structure _in a language other than JavaScript_.

## Quality Rubric

**Well formatted code**
- Code uses a linter, which can be invoked with a command (e.g. `npm run lint`). [50 points]
- Running the linter on all source code files generates no linting errors. [50 points]

**Clear and useful README**
- Repository includes a README file with installation and setup instructions. [25 points]
- Repository includes a README file with usage instructions and at least one example use case. [25 points]

**Proper dependency management**
- There is a command to install dependencies (e.g. `npm install`) and it is specified in the installation and setup instructions of the README. [50 points]

**Good project management**
- Commit messages are concise and descriptive. [25 points]
- All features are added via pull requests. [25 points]
- Every pull request has a description summarizing the changes made. [25 points]
- Every pull request has been reviewed by at least one other person. [25 points]
